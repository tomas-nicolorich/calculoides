# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root — points to one `CONTEXT.md` per package. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. Also check `<package>/docs/adr/` for package-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

```
/
├── CONTEXT-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                    ← system-wide decisions
├── api/
│   └── CONTEXT.md               ← backend patterns and API conventions
├── frontend/
│   └── CONTEXT.md               ← UI patterns and component conventions
└── shared/
    └── CONTEXT.md               ← core domain vocabulary and financial concepts
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
